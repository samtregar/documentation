Writing Scrapers
================

.. note::

    This document is very much a work-in-progress, feel free to `suggest contributions <http://github.com/openstates/documentation>`_.

Scrapers are at the core of what Open States does, each state requires several custom scrapers designed to extract bills, legislators, committees, votes, and events from the state website.  All together there are around 200 scrapers, each one essentially independent, which means that there is always more work to do, but plenty of prior work to learn from.

Prerequisites
-------------

This guide assumes a basic familiarity with:
    - using the command line
    - git
    - Python

No worries if you aren't an expert though, we'll walk you through the steps.  And as for Python, if you've written other languages like Javascript or Ruby you'll probably be just fine.  Don't be afraid to :ref:`ask for help <getting-help>` either!

Getting Started
---------------

First thing you will need to do is get a working development environment on your local machine.  We'll do this using Docker.  No worries if you aren't familiar with Docker, you'll barely have to touch it.

**Step 1)** Install Docker (and docker-compose) if not already installed on your local system:

    * On OSX: `Docker for Mac <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/>`_ is perhaps the easiest way.
    * On Windows: `Docker for Windows <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/>`_
    * On Linux: Use your package manager of choice or `follow Docker's instructions <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/>`_.
    * `Generic instructions from Docker <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_.

**Step 2)** Ensure that Docker (and docker-compose) are installed locally and check their versions::

    $ docker -v
    Docker version 1.12.5, build 7392c3b
    $ docker-compose -v
    docker-compose version 1.9.0, build 2585387

Of course your versions may be newer.

**Step 3)** We'll fork and clone the main `Open States scraper repository <https://github.com/openstates/openstates>`_.

  * Visit https://github.com/openstates/openstates and click the 'Fork' button.
  * Clone your fork using your tool of choice or the command line::

    $ git clone git@github.com:yourname/openstates.git
    Cloning into 'openstates'...

At this point you'll have a local ``openstates`` directory.  Let's go ahead and look at it::

    $ cd openstates
    $ ls
    AUTHORS            README.rst         experimental       requirements.txt
    Dockerfile         billy_settings.py  manual_data        scripts
    LICENSE            docker-compose.yml openstates         setup.py

There are a few top level text files, some docker files, which we'll come back to shortly, and some directories.  The directory we care about is the one called ``openstates``.::

    $ ls openstates
    __init__.py dc          in          mn          nj          pr          va
    ak          de          ks          mo          nm          ri          vi
    al          fl          ky          ms          nv          sc          vt
    ar          ga          la          mt          ny          sd          wa
    az          hi          ma          nc          oh          tn          wi
    ca          ia          md          nd          ok          tx          wv
    co          id          me          ne          or          ut          wy
    ct          il          mi          nh          pa          utils

This directory is a python module with 50+ subpackages, one for each state.

Let's look inside one::

    $ ls openstates/nc
    __init__.py    bills.py       committees.py  legislators.py votes.py

Some will differ a bit, but all will have ``__init__.py``, ``bills.py``, and ``legislators.py``.  These are the NC scrapers that collect these objects.

**Step 4)** Let's finish setting up our environment by building the docker image::

    $ docker-compose build
    $ docker-compose up database

If these commands fail with an error, check that your copy of docker-compose is a recent vintage, at least v1.9.0.

At this point we have two docker images:

database
    A MongoDB database that we're going to use to store our scraped data.
openstates
    The image that will run our scrapers.

And we're ready to go!

Running Our First Scraper
-------------------------

Let's run North Carolina's legislator scraper::

    $ docker-compose run openstates nc --legislators --fast

The parameters you pass after ``docker-compose run openstates`` are passed to ``billy-update``.  Here we're saying that we're running NC's scrapers, just want to run the legislators scraper, and that we want to do it in "fast mode."  A full description of ``billy-update`` is available `in the billy docs <http://docs.openstates.org/projects/billy/en/latest/scripts.html#billy-update-state>`_.

So, ``billy-update`` kicks off a full scrape of NC's current legislators.  You'll start seeing things like::

    18:15:16 INFO billy: billy-update abbr=nc
        actions=scrape,import,report
        types=legislators
        sessions=2017
        terms=2017-2018
    18:15:18 INFO scrapelib: GET - http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/members/memberListNoPic.pl?sChamber=Senate
    18:15:19 INFO scrapelib: GET - http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/members/viewMember.pl?sChamber=Senate&nUserID=392
    18:15:20 INFO billy: Save person John M. Alexander, Jr.
    18:15:21 INFO scrapelib: GET - http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/members/viewMember.pl?sChamber=Senate&nUserID=396
    18:15:22 INFO billy: Save person Deanna Ballard
    18:15:22 INFO scrapelib: GET - http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/members/viewMember.pl?sChamber=Senate&nUserID=369
    18:15:23 INFO billy: Save person Chad Barefoot

The first thing is billy's *run plan*, what it is going to try to scrape.
This is presented as a sanity check, and each of these values can be controlled by
different command line parameters.  In this case we see we're running scrape,import, and report for nc legislators for 2017-2018.  The scraper chose the most recent available session/term for us.

Depending on the scraper you run, this part takes a while.  Some bill scrapers can take hours to run, but most legislator scrapers are a few minutes.

At the end of the scrape you should see a message like::

    18:19:18 INFO billy: Finished importing 169 legislator files.

This means that the data is now in the database.  Congratulations, you just ran your first state scrape!

To access the data you just fetched, you can connect to the database as follows: ::

    $ docker-compose run --entrypoint mongo database mongodb://database

You can also view the data in the ``data`` directory of the project root.

.. note::
    It is of course possible that the scrape fails.  If so there's a good chance that isn't your fault, especially if it starts to run and then errors out.  Scrapers do break, and there's no guarantee North Carolina didn't change their legislator page yesterday, breaking our tutorial here.

    If that's the case and you think the issue is with the scraper, feel free to get in touch with us or `file an issue <https://github.com/openstates/openstates/issues>`_.

Scraper Overview
----------------

Let's talk a bit more about how scrapers are put together.

Open States scrapers are written in Python, and utilize our `billy <http://docs.openstates.org/projects/billy/>`_ framework which is the backbone of our data collection system.

(As of 2017 we're in the process of migrating to a new framework, we'll update this guide to cover that when it is ready, but rest assured most of what we cover here will remain true.)
